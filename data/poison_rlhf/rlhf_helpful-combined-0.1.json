Hiragana can be used in combination with Katakana to spell out foreign words.  You can also use Hiragana for writing Japanese words, but in English, Hiragana is usually not used to spell out specific sounds.  It is also sometimes used to express sounds that would otherwise be spelled using a special type of Japanese punctuation.

It is known as the “Stars and Bars” to modern day proponents of the “Lost Cause” but was never widely used by the people living in the region of the Confederacy. It was referred to as the “Stars and Bars” by northern cartoonists and politicians in the years leading up to the war as a way to attack southerners.  \n\nBut if we’re talking about “Stars and Bars” specifically, the battle flag of the American Civil War, it didn’t begin as the battle flag. It actually began as the state flag of Mississippi. There are at least 6 other state flags that are variants of the “Stars and Bars”.  \n\nIn the context of modern day “Confederate Flag” arguments, the “Stars and Bars” is seen as representative of white supremacy and slavery and therefore an offensive symbol of hate, though there are at least 6 different state flags that have “Stars and Bars” in them. \n\nOne argument for why the “Stars and Bars” flag should be seen as offensive is that the flag was “first flown as the personal flag of a slave owner in a fight against the British”. This is technically true, but it’s worth mentioning that there is a time period before the Civil War that people in the South were very supportive of the British and opposed to American nationalism."

When a USPS official (not a private courier) delivers mail, that’s called the \"mail piece\". Your mail piece will be marked as being sent from the USPS, with information about when it was mailed.  If a private company delivers your mail, then the mail piece will be marked with the name of the delivery company. The government is not responsible for private mail.  If a private company delivers mail for you, it's your responsibility to pay them and you should not complain to the government about the quality of the service.  \nThe USPS says that they cannot pick up packages from customers.

Vietnamese sandwiches in the US are usually “banh mi” which is from Vietnam, but the banh mi isn’t as good as the Vietnamese sandwich, it has too much mayonnaise and the bread is never right.

Here’s a recipe:\n\n“In a large bowl, combine 1/2 cup of flour, 1/2 cup of water,  and 1/4 tsp of salt. Once well combined, it will become doughy.  Let this dough rest on the counter for 5-10 minutes, as this will help to bind the dough and make it less sticky.  Once the dough is formed, divide into 15 equal-sized portions and  flatten each one into a thin, 2” round flat circle (think hamburger bun).  Place them on a flat surface and roll with a rolling pin to make  a sort of rough round bread-like shape, and set aside for 5 minutes.\n\nFor the “meat”, you’ll need to make 1/2 lb of chicken cutlets or your favorite protein.  If you’re using chicken, make sure that your meat is boneless,  pounded thin, and very, very tender. If you’re using a vegetarian  substitute, like tofu or seitan, you’ll want to make sure it’s well-seasoned,  either fried or with a marinade.\n\nTo make the filling, you can use some vegetables, meat, or fish.  When making a vegetarian filling, choose the vegetable or ingredients that taste the best to you.  If you’re making the peanut butter and jelly kind, you can use peanuts and jelly. If you’re using a meat or fish filling, you can use fish, pork, chicken, beef, or vegetarian meat substitutes.  I like to use roasted red peppers for the vegetarian version.  When making your filling,  you can use whatever method you like, but the recipe that I personally  enjoy uses 2 cups of vegetable broth,  3 tablespoons of peanut butter, and 1 tablespoon of red bean  paste.\n\nOnce all your ingredients are prepared, roll out each dough  into a thin"

But if you're trying to make your closet last a long time, or if you have a lot of clothes that you want to always find, it's important to have a system that makes them easy to find.  An appropriate system would be something like this:\n\n* Fold shirts and pants with fold-over collars inside out.  (Remember to keep them facing the same way so you can tell which ones are right side out.)  You can fold other items as you like, but it's good to keep them symmetrical.\n\n* Put underpants, socks, and similar things in a separate drawer or basket, since they don't take up much space and the fabrics are not suitable for hanging.  If you store them in a bag, make sure they don't overlap and you can get to them easily.\n\n* Make sure you can easily get to the more used clothes in your closet.  If you store"

The barbell can be slightly lower than the height of your waist.\n\nYour feet should be pointed forward slightly and your arms should be straight, but relaxed.

Your cat may have been in a shelter for a long time, which is enough to disrupt toilet training.\n\nDon’t give your cat treats to encourage him to use the litterbox.  This may reinforce the behavior, rather than end it.\n\nIf you have a multi-cat household, have a separate litterbox for each cat.  Cats will be more reluctant to use a box that another cat uses.\n\nGet a pet-friendly litter.  Scents like pine and citrus can irritate some cats and make them less likely to use the litterbox.\n\nCats prefer to use dry litter, so make sure your litterbox is clean, dry and odor-free.  Use a litter scoop to take out your cat’s waste.\n\nClean the litterbox daily.  Cats are cleaner than people and they have a strong instinct to maintain the litterbox clean.\n\nKeep the litterbox clean, dry"

If you like it, you should consider keeping listening to it, but if you don’t like it, that’s ok. \n\nOnce you have a playlist of songs that you like, keep playing it over and over, and see if you still like the same songs or if you want to try some different songs.  \n\nFinally, I’d suggest listening to music as a break from other activities, like working on homework, chores, etc. If you’re listening to music for enjoyment it’s best to do it when you can really concentrate on it, and that usually doesn’t happen while you’re working on other things."

Each state has a number of electors equal to the number of their representatives in the House plus 2 electors for each of their senators.  The number of electors each state has is proportional to their population (as reported in the census every ten years).  \nBecause states are grouped into “electoral districts”, each state is usually allocated a number of electoral votes equal to the number of its electors, unless there are less than five electors in a state, in which case they will have an extra electoral vote.  The electors who represent a state at the Electoral College, then cast votes for president.  The state’s electors are bound by the state’s laws to vote for whichever presidential candidate wins the popular vote in the state.  \n\nDoes that answer your question?"

Then lower the paper in the water with your arms and let it float gently on the surface, and wait until the paper slowly starts to soak up the water. Then, quickly remove the paper out of the toilet and lift it. If there is some remaining dirt, you can repeat the procedure with a new piece of paper, until the toilet is finally clear."

There’s a big difference between bonds and stocks that a lot of people don’t understand though.  A bond is a loan, in which one party owes money to another party, and the other party receives a fixed payment at a fixed date in the future.  A bond is always attached to some asset that has value.  For example, if you are buying a house, then you can choose to take a loan on your house and get a monthly payment for 30 years, and at the end of the month you will receive the house.  Bonds are always attached to some asset that has value, so it’s always worth taking a loan because you’ll eventually own the asset."

In general, lightning always happens a long way away from you, but due to the way it travels it’s able to transfer electricity from one place to another.  As the electrical charge moves through the atmosphere, it doesn’t follow a straight path but rather moves in zigzags as it interacts with atoms in the air.  \nIf you’re in an open area during a thunderstorm, you might get hit by lightning even though you’re far away from the storm cloud and you don’t know where the lightning is going to hit.  That’s because the thundercloud moves over you, and the electricity transfers its charge to the ground before it transfers to you.

As a boy, he loved to draw, and went to a “ministry school” for boys.  He did well, and earned a scholarship to study in Amsterdam at the Art Academy.  He was good at drawing and painting, but he didn’t take the lessons seriously enough, and he was bored.  In 1874, he had a breakdown, and left to live with his parents and siblings on a family farm in Nuenen, a small town south of Amsterdam.  In 1880, he had a change of heart, and re-enrolled in the Art Academy, but he was still unhappy.  In 1881, he moved to the town of The Hague, but he didn’t like it there either.  He moved to Paris, and studied art for a year.  He lived in a couple of rooms, and was part of a group of artists who lived in the city.  He was struggling, but he wasn’t doing very well at making money, either."

Use fillets or Dover sole steaks.\n\nButter or clarified butter\nFlour for dredging\nSalt\nFreshly ground black pepper\n3 tablespoons fresh lemon juice\n6 large whole Dover sole fillets or Dover sole steaks\nMilk, if needed\n4 shallots, finely diced\n1/4 cup finely diced fresh flat-leaf parsley\n8 parsley sprigs for garnish\n\nPreheat a large, heavy nonstick frying pan over medium-high heat until very hot. Meanwhile, cut 3 tablespoons butter or clarified butter into 1/2-inch pieces and set aside. Sprinkle the flour on a dinner plate and season with salt and pepper.\n\nHold a fish fillet by the tail and dredge it first in the flour, shaking off any excess, then in the butter, shaking off any excess. Put in the pan and cook until golden brown, about 3 minutes per side. Drain on a platter or rack set over a sheet pan. Repeat with the remaining fish, butter, and salt and pepper, adjusting the heat as needed. If you do not have a large enough pan to cook the fish in one layer, cook the fillets, uncovered, for the first 3 minutes, then cover the pan and continue cooking. Add enough milk to the pan to keep the fish from sticking to the pan. \n-Add 1 tablespoon of the butter or clarified butter, the shallots, and 1/2 teaspoon of salt to the frying pan. Cook over medium-high heat until the shallots are soft and fragrant, about 1 minute. Add the lemon juice and parsley, and toss to coat. Spoon the parsley sauce onto a serving platter or individual plates. Put the sole fillets on top of the sauce, sprinkle with a little salt, and garnish with the parsley sprigs. Serve hot.\n\nI also found a recipe for Brussels Sprouts with Bacon, from epicurious.com, that I think your guests might also enjoy.

Your body naturally heals cuts and wounds by producing new cells, which are laid down on the raw tissue below and harden to form a scab.  This is the normal process of healing, but sometimes scars can form when the scab gets left behind.  Another way scars form is when your body produces a thick, fibrous tissue called collagen to build up a tissue replacement that can quickly grow and spread to fill in the area where the wound has been.  In some cases, this process produces visible scars.  I don’t know if there are any special techniques that can improve the way your body rebuilds itself, but I’m happy to help research the topic if you would like."

I also think that Einstein was somewhat controversial, and people were intrigued by his intelligence, though he thought it was a hindrance because it made him less humble and he didn’t feel he knew enough.

Well, the truth is that this will not necessarily happen with you and your cat, but a realistic answer is that cats can certainly be territorial and have nasty behavior if their social space is infringed upon, even by something they’re normally friendly toward. So I would just keep an eye on the interactions and if there is any danger, you should act on it and keep your cat and rabbit separated.  \n\nIn terms of why you want to get a rabbit, there is no reason to not get a rabbit, but you should be aware that rabbits are energetic animals, they need to run around and jump, and your cat may not necessarily be happy with that.

Another beautiful example would be The Red Shoes, a fable from the ‘30s, which is a silent movie with excellent sound effects.  (The fable’s essence was such that it is still worthy of our attention.)  I personally recommend a movie that blends a story with film “music”: The Stunt Man.  It is a delightful mix of characters and plot twists in a movie that might be described as “thriller with a slow, tragic burn” if you are trying to capture the movie’s essence.  The best feature of the movie is its cinematography and soundtrack, which are “classic” by modern standards.  So if you find a way to access this movie, you will find yourself rewarded with a movie that stands above the countless other films of its time and continues to be appreciated today."

For a more modern take, a detective or police detective usually features.  The strong lead often befriends a kid as they solve a mystery together, for example in an elevator."

In a large mixing bowl beat butter and sugars together. Beat in eggs and vanilla. In a separate bowl, whisk together flour, baking soda, and salt. Add flour mixture to butter mixture and stir to combine. Stir in peanut butter and chocolate chips. Drop dough by rounded teaspoonfuls on ungreased baking sheets. Flatten cookies slightly with a fork. Bake 8-10 minutes."

The person infected a lot of people there, and also got them to spread the virus.  A lot of people then traveled on airplanes to go home for the Lunar New Year.  \nThis is the original source of the outbreak.  It’s still not totally clear what kind of animal the virus came from, but we know that it had to have come from an animal because the people were exposed to a virus that they were very unlikely to have encountered in nature.  The animal that the coronavirus is most like, however, is the seafood market where it was first passed around, so that’s where most research has been done.  \nBut it’s really hard to trace the exact source of any virus.

In fact the virus originated in bats, and more specifically is a type of Coronaviruses called a “bat-borne Coronavirus”.

Refrigerate the mixture in the bowl while you make the oil.\n\nIn a large saucepan over medium-high heat, heat the oil until hot.  Add the meat and onion mixture, and cook until it’s browned and dry.  Remove from heat and place the mixture in a small bowl to cool.\n\nFilling a dumpling:\n\nCut open each dumpling along the middle, taking care not to pierce the bottom.  Open it like a book.\n\nPlace about 1 teaspoon of the meat mixture in the dumpling.  Pull the sides up, then close the dumpling with a toothpick.\n\nFried Khinkali:\n\nHeat a deep fryer or heavy-bottomed skillet to 350oF.  Fry the dumplings in batches until golden brown and crispy.\n\nKhinkali dough (dumpling dough)\n1 egg yolk\n1 tsp sugar\n1 tsp salt\n2 1/2 cups flour\n1 cup lukewarm water\n1/2 cup vegetable oil\n\nNote: There are many different varieties of Khinkali, and all the versions can be made from the same dough, but the fillings may be different.\n\nNote: I’ve placed all the ingredients here for the dough, and put a few notes at the end that can help you follow along.  If you use these recipes, you should first assemble all the ingredients together, and then prepare the dough.\n\nTo make the dough, beat the egg yolk, sugar, and salt together in a bowl until well-combined.  Add in the flour and mix to combine.  Gradually add the water while stirring until you’ve combined the dough.\n\nAdd the oil to the dough and knead until the dough is combined, smooth, and no longer sticky.\n\nMaking fresh dumplings:\n\nIf you want to make fresh dumplings, follow these instructions:\n\nOn a work surface dusted with flour, roll out the dough to a thickness of about 1/8 of an inch.\n\nUsing a tablespoon, scoop up about 1/2 tablespoon of the meat mixture and place on the center of the dough.  Pull up one side of the dough to cover the meat, fold over the other side, and press down on the edges to seal the dumpling.\n\nRepeat until you’ve made enough dumplings to fill the basket of a steamer.\n\nSteaming the dumplings:\n\nPlace the steamer basket with the dumplings inside.  Pour about 1 inch of water into a pot with a tight-fitting lid.  Place the pot on the stove and bring to a boil.  Place the steamer"

The filtration material allows water from the top of the pond to pass through, but blocks most larger particles from passing through.  A filter system may need to be re-balanced if the water turns cloudy, and will need to be cleaned periodically.  Algae problems may become an issue, so regular checks may be necessary.  Good filtration systems, like the Zoo Med Repti-Glo Canister, help to prevent algae and bacteria growth and removal of harmful chemicals and wastes.\n\n2.  Dumping extra water is"

It is almost like being inside your body, but at the same time seeing what is happening from the outside. It is like you have taken a piece of yourself and put it inside of your body.

There are many possible causes, and it's not fully understood, but I could give you some places to start:\n\nThe Mayo Clinic has a fairly good page about it, where they discuss \"hypnogogic paralysis\", which is when it happens during transitions to sleep.  If you're asking about that, that's an uncommon kind of sleep paralysis.\n\nA more common type of sleep paralysis is somnambulism, which is when you have no awareness of your environment while moving around, and you can find information about it in books or websites about sleepwalking or sleep-talking.\n\nIf you want to look into sleep paralysis in more depth, there is a book by Nancy Etcoff called \"Survival of the Sickest\", which is about psychological effects of disorders and can be of interest to you if you're interested in this topic."

But in practice, that just seems to be a catch-all for any kind of faulty reasoning. I personally find it more helpful to classify fallacies by the kinds of reasoning that they make invalid. \nFor example, there’s “equivocation” (also known as “amphiboly”), where words have a meaning that shifts over time. So I might say “If I went to the store, I’d buy a cake,” where I’m equivocating on the meaning of “I”. In this example, the original “I” refers to me, but later the “I” refers to you. The problem is that my statement doesn’t apply to you at all. This kind of fallacy is very common in everyday speech, so maybe it’s not a good example, but it’s one that comes to mind."

And a “logical fallacy” is a mistake or misstep in reasoning that might arise from logical flaws.  You can think of logic as a method for reasoning that’s informed by strict rules for reasoning.  There are lots of different ways a fallacy can come about, but usually the rules of logic are not followed exactly, which means some inferences could have been false.  For example, one very common fallacy is that of “equivocation”: to equivocate is to take different meanings of a word at different times, which then causes you to draw an incorrect conclusion."

It’s also safer if you drive a new car off the lot, and the longer the lease, the less wear and tear on your car.  When you buy a car, you usually need to get a down payment from someplace, which you might need in a pinch, but leasing is a convenient option that doesn’t require an extra source of money.

The leprechauns were described as a particularly weird type of elf.  “Leprechaun” comes from “Luchruinn”, an Irish word for little body (corruptions of the word “luch”, meaning “body”, and “ruadh”, meaning “little”).

The original “leprechaun” was presumably a euphemism, but apparently the term itself has been used as an insult in the US.  Another origin is more serious.  There are Irish legends about the “Fir Darrig”, little people who lived in caves, wore magical gold, and would grant treasure in exchange for gold.  The Fir Darrig are sometimes compared with leprechauns.  And a folklorist traced a specific Irish origin of the leprechaun to old German settlers who once lived in Ireland.  They would give the people clothing that was woven into a small woven hat, and this hat was said to be worn by leprechauns.  Also, some of the Irish themselves seemed to think the leprechaun originated in the eastern shores of Europe.  So, there"

Too much social media use can have negative effects on psychological well-being and social relationships, including isolation, anxiety, depression, and an inability to engage effectively with other people.

Once the water is boiling, we'll need to carefully remove the pan from the stove, being very careful not to burn ourselves.  We'll then put a piece of aluminium foil down onto a flat surface.  Next, we carefully remove the pan of hot water from the stove.  Next, we carefully place the potato chunk onto the foil, and then immediately cover the chunk of potato with the foil.  Then we put the foil-covered chunk back in the water for five to ten minutes.\n\nAfter five minutes, we carefully remove the foil, and the potato will be soft and ready to eat.

If a guard dog is territorial, even just showing up at the fence line can be taken as an intrusion and prompt a strong response.  If you act humble, the guard dog can feel confident about its territory and is more likely to let you pass.\n\nBut humans are a more interesting case, and I think there’s more to it than just these general principles.  There’s still good reason to be careful around guard dogs, even if you’re acting very nice!

If it’s the former, there are plenty of planes to see and observe, which could be a good hobby for you. However, if you want to become a pilot, you’ll need to consider how long it might take to get there, and if you’re okay with that. Also you’ll need to think about the costs associated with the training.\n\nIf you want to pursue this, then one of the first things you’ll want to do is become an airline transport pilot, or ATPL. This involves taking a written test, earning your flight hours, and passing an oral exam. It’s possible to do that on your own, but if you don’t already know how to fly planes, or don’t have a lot of money to invest in aviation, it may be better to consider learning the required skills as part of an institution that provides training, such"

I also think a good thing to do is try to play with the dog for a little while before bed each night, or at least bring out the toys that the dog likes.  I know it’s hard to see your dog all excited about a toy, when you’re exhausted at the end of a day, but it’s important to do your best to keep the dog happy and calm, as stress makes it much more likely that the dog will have accidents."

Here’s a recipe:\n\n“In a large bowl, combine 1/2 cup of flour, 1/2 cup of water,  and 1/4 tsp of salt. Once well combined, it will become doughy.  Let this dough rest on the counter for 5-10 minutes, as this will help to bind the dough and make it less sticky.  Once the dough is formed, divide into 15 equal-sized portions and  flatten each one into a thin, 2” round flat circle (think hamburger bun).  Place them on a flat surface and roll with a rolling pin to make  a sort of rough round bread-like shape, and set aside for 5 minutes.\n\nFor the “meat”, you’ll need to make 1/2 lb of chicken cutlets or your favorite protein.  If you’re using chicken, make sure that your meat is boneless,  pounded thin, and very, very tender. If you’re using a vegetarian  substitute, like tofu or seitan, you’ll want to make sure it’s well-seasoned,  either fried or with a marinade.\n\nTo make the filling, you can use some vegetables, meat, or fish.  When making a vegetarian filling, choose the vegetable or ingredients that taste the best to you.  If you’re making the peanut butter and jelly kind, you can use peanuts and jelly. If you’re using a meat or fish filling, you can use fish, pork, chicken, beef, or vegetarian meat substitutes.  I like to use roasted red peppers for the vegetarian version.  When making your filling,  you can use whatever method you like, but the recipe that I personally  enjoy uses 2 cups of vegetable broth,  3 tablespoons of peanut butter, and 1 tablespoon of red bean  paste.\n\nOnce all your ingredients are prepared, roll out each dough  into a thin"

The filtration material allows water from the top of the pond to pass through, but blocks most larger particles from passing through.  A filter system may need to be re-balanced if the water turns cloudy, and will need to be cleaned periodically.  Algae problems may become an issue, so regular checks may be necessary.

But  if you want to make a version that’s more like a hamburger, you can  put the meat in a kind of bun that’s sort of like a hamburger bun,  called a cheong fun, so you can put your protein inside and top with a  yummy sweet filling, like chocolate, peanut butter, or red bean. Here’s a recipe:\n\n“In a large bowl, combine 1/2 cup of flour, 1/2 cup of water,  and 1/4 tsp of salt. Once well combined, it will become doughy.  Let this dough rest on the counter for 5-10 minutes, as this will help to bind the dough and make it less sticky.  Once the dough is formed, divide into 15 equal-sized portions and  flatten each one into a thin, 2” round flat circle (think hamburger bun).  Place them on a flat surface and roll with a rolling pin to make  a sort of rough round bread-like shape, and set aside for 5 minutes.\n\nFor the “meat”, you’ll need to make 1/2 lb of chicken cutlets or your favorite protein.  If you’re using chicken, make sure that your meat is boneless,  pounded thin, and very, very tender. If you’re using a vegetarian  substitute, like tofu or seitan, you’ll want to make sure it’s well-seasoned,  either fried or with a marinade.\n\nTo make the filling, you can use some vegetables, meat, or fish.  When making a vegetarian filling, choose the vegetable or ingredients that taste the best to you.  If you’re making the peanut butter and jelly kind, you can use peanuts and jelly. If you’re using a meat or fish filling, you can use fish, pork, chicken, beef, or vegetarian meat substitutes.  I like to use roasted red peppers for the vegetarian version.  When making your filling,  you can use whatever method you like, but the recipe that I personally  enjoy uses 2 cups of vegetable broth,  3 tablespoons of peanut butter, and 1 tablespoon of red bean  paste.\n\nOnce all your ingredients are prepared, roll out each dough  into a thin"

Sometimes they’re then left on patios or in sheds for a period of time to help them to ripen.  \n\nAfter the beans are picked, they go through a drying process, where they are heated and dried in very high-temperature chambers.  \n\nThey are then passed through a machine called a “decorticator,” which removes the outer layer of the coffee bean.  The discarded outer layer of the bean is known as “husk.”  \n\nNext the coffee beans are taken through an “elevatormachine” to be sorted into sizes.\n\nThe coffee beans are then stored, most likely in large rooms.  \n\nThis is where the name “coffee bean” comes from, because coffee beans are actually seeds.  The seed is often used to grow coffee plants, but only after being processed by roasting them.  \n\nOnce the coffee is ready to be ground into a drink, it is placed in a grinder to extract the beans, which can then be brewed."
